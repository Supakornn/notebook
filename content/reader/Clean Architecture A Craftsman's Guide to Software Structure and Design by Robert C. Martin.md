### Chapter 1: What Is Design and Architecture?

**Architecture vs Design**: There is no difference between the two, not at all. It's just a matter of perspective. Architecture focuses on high-level structure, while design focuses on low-level details. However, both must work together for optimal results.

The goal of software design is simple:

> "The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system."

Developers who say "we can clean it up later" are often overconfident, believing they'll have time to refactor in the future. But that time never comes because the work is never truly done, and there's no capacity to go back and clean things up. This leads to a pile of messes that accumulate and overlap. The best approach is to do it right the first time.

> "The only way to go fast, is to go well."

When you prioritize software design, it benefits your work in many waysâ€”not just your individual tasks, but the entire team's workflow. Clean architecture makes collaboration easier, reduces costs, and from an executive perspective, it's crucial to ensure your team's work is maintainable and sustainable for the long term.
