title: How to run a html live-server from Terminal

Since I started using Zed as my main editor, I’ve run into a few annoying problems.  
One of them is the lack of a _live-server_ feature.

Here’s how I solved it:

1. [bun](https://bun.com) recommended)

```shell
bun index.html
```

2. [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

```shell
live-server
```
