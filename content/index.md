Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm **Supakorn** or you can call me **Gap** and this is my digital garden where I put all the stuff I learn and think about.

Think of this like my public notebook. I write about things I'm working on, stuff I find interesting, and random thoughts that pop into my head. It's not perfect, and sometimes my English might be a bit weird (I'm still learning!), but that's okay - this is just me sharing what I know.

#### A little bit about me

I'm a student at [sit,kmutt](https://sit.kmutt.ac.th/) who loves tinkering with code and learning new things. I enjoy software development, cybersecurity (especially CTFs), and exploring different programming languages and frameworks.

This website is my way of learning in public - sharing what I discover along the way. If you found something useful here or want to chat, feel free to reach out on my [X](https://twitter.com/supak0rnn). I'd love to connect!

#### How this works

This site is built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and all my notes are connected. You can click on the links to jump between topics, or just browse around and see what catches your eye.

> Everything here is a work in progress. I update things as I learn more, so don't be surprised if you see changes. That's just how gardens grow! ðŸŒ±
